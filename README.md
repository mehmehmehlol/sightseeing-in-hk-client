Sightseeing in Hong Kong 
====

## Objectives

This project is designed for users to enjoy a one-stop service to visit all the popular places in Hong Kong. Users can also customize their experience by creating an account and favorite places.

## Motivations

I wrote a >40page Google Doc for a friend who was visiting Hong Kong in summer 2018. As much as I like planning and recommending places for my friends, I wanted to make the documents into something more abstract and creative. Now that I have possessed web development skills, I decided to transform that Google Doc into a website. A user-friendly and simplistic looking website.
